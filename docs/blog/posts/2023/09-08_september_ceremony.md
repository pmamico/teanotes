## Notes  

August was long and hot, but September has arrived offering a little oasis.  
To celebrate this, I cleaned my home and found some leftover teas from the past in the drawer, which I enjoyed.   
Now I couldn't focus on the taste composition of the tea; instead, it was a spiritual immersion in the tea ceremony.   
Oh, and you can see my tea bushes in the picture, yes, I finally have my own bushes! I will write more about them later.
