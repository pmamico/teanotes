## Notes

On my balcony today, the sun brewed a milky oolong.
I've had this package for a while; I received it a few years ago as a birthday gift along with other teas, I took out the remaining portion now. I remember not enjoying it as much back then, but I might have spoiled its preparation because I could taste some bitter notes. This time I prepared it with greater care, and behold, the creamy milk flavors and complex fruity aromas emerged. The taste reminded me of raspberry, very sweet. It's an easily drinkable and approachable tea that I would gladly recommend to beginners. Those who have had more tea experiences will also find some tricky nuances in it.On my balcony today, the sun brewed a milky oolong tea.
