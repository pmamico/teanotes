## Notes

It was a rainy day with golden sunshine as I walked along Váci street after a long day at work.  
Not only the sunshine, but my tea today was also golden.   
The _Golden steed eyebrow_ is a summer harvested and heavily fermented tea  
from the Wuyi mountains. The cloudy infusion has the luscious aroma of autumn leaves along with mellow dark cocoa notes.  
What surprised me was that I discovered a lot of citrusy and rosé-like flavors in it.
