## Notes

A high mountain tea on the mountain!   
What a harmony and freedom is captured in this tea,   
just like the bridge that was visible from Gellért Hill.   
The creamy aftertaste surprised me the most in this oolong, which has huge leaves rolled up together.   
It is a balanced, airy, yet full-bodied tea.  
It's worth mentioning that high mountain teas are known for their complex and delicate flavors,   
due to the specific environmental conditions in which they are grown.   
These conditions include high altitude, cooler temperatures, and often misty or foggy weather,   
all of which result in slower growth and development of the tea leaves,   
leading to a more nuanced flavor profile.
