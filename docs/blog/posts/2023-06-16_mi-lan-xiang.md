## Notes

Strong fruity aroma and a lingering taste of peach.  
The tea leaves was first withered and then roasted in an oven, which gives them a rich, toasty flavor with hints of caramel and nuts.  
Darker color and a deeper, more complex flavor compared to other oolong teas.   
This energizing tea is sure to invigorate your senses and leave you feeling refreshed.
