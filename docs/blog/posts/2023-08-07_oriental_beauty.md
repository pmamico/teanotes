## Notes  

Oriental Beauty, also known as Dong Fang Mei Ren or Baihao Oolong, is a unique type of Oolong tea that originates from Hsinchu County, Taiwan.   
It is often referred to as "Champagne Oolong" due to its distinctive fruity flavor.  
This tea stands out because it is harvested in the summer, when tiny little green leafhoppers bite the leaves and stimulate the plant to produce a sweet,   
nectar-like characteristic.   
The process of making Oriental Beauty tea involves several steps including withering, stirring, fermenting, and baking.   
The high degree of fermentation, around 60-70%, brings out a rich complexity in the tea's flavor.   
The liquor of this tea often presents a beautiful amber color with sweet and muscatel bouquet.   
A proper brew of Oriental Beauty can bring forth a multi-layered taste, with notes ranging from ripe fruits to honey, often leaving a lasting aftertaste that is refreshing and comforting.
