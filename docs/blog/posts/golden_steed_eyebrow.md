## Notes

It was a rainy day with golden sunshine as I walked along Váci street after a long day at work.  
Not only the sunshine, but my tea today was also golden.   
The _Golden steed eyebrow_ is a summer harvested and heavily fermented tea from the Wuyi mountains.  
The cloudy infusion has the luscious aroma of autumn leaves along with mellow dark cocoa flavours.
