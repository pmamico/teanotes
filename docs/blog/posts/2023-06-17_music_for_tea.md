## Martin Nonstatic: Ligand

Characterized by a seamless flow that effortlessly carries the listener  
through a rich tapestry of intricate details and subtle nuances.  
Despite the abundance of sonic events and happenings, the album maintains a cohesive,  
overarching theme that unifies the entire listening experience.   
From start to finish, the album is a captivating journey   
that invites the listener to lose themselves in its lush soundscapes   
and immersive textures.   
It is a testament to the artist's skill and vision  
that such a complex and multifaceted work can feel so natural.  
  
I recommend listening to this music in the late hours of the evening, accompanied by a cup of Bai Hao Yinzhen (aka silver needle) tea.  
It is worth listening to with headphones.
