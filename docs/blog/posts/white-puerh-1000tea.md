## Notes

This tea was made from young tea leaves that are allowed to wither and dry naturally, without undergoing extensive oxidation.  
Characterized by its purity, balance, and a sensation that almost  
mirrors the act of breathing while drinking.  
This tea boasts a moderate body and a floral aroma that is sure to delight the senses.  
Great for relax.
