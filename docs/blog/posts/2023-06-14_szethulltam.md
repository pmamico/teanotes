# Koan

A koan is a paradoxical or enigmatic anecdote, often defy logical reasoning and challenge the mind to go beyond conventional thinking in order to attain insight and enlightenment.  
Here are a few examples that I particularly enjoy.  

!!! quote "Tandori"

    I fell apart to  
    the one and only bit that  
    Iâ€™ve been all the time.

!!! quote "Ryokan"

    Though I think not  
    To think about it,  
    I do think about it  
    And shed tears  
    Thinking about it. 

!!! quote "Tandori"

    Further from you?  
    Closer to you?  
    Neither from you nor to you.  
    Neither near or far.  

!!! quote "Mike Essig"

    Am I drinking  
    the whiskey  
    or is the whiskey  
    drinking me?

!!! quote "Tandori"

    Silence instead of sound,  
    But silence instead of what?


!!! quote "?"

    Who am I?  
    Am I?  
    Am?  
    .

!!! quote "Greg Gaul"

    ...Through a inner path  
    You can go in the outside  
    Where all is
