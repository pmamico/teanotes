## Sync24: Source


Sync24's "Source" album is a mesmerizing ambient journey.  
The physical vinyl itself has a green hue, which perfectly complements the lush,   
organic soundscapes contained within.   
The music unfolds gently yet purposefully,   
like a seedling sprouting into a full-grown plant.   
Overall, "Source" is a masterful example of ambient music that is both soothing and thought-provoking.  
Not only does a good frothy matcha tea complement it in color, but also in its life-giving power.
