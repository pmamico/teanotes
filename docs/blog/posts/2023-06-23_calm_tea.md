I tasted a boxed ice tea made from high-quality oolong tea,   
which was a unique experience for me.

The packaging is tasteful, and the tea is   
refreshing with a subtle oolong flavor and not too much sugar.  
While it cannot compare to the traditional Chinese tea ceremony,   
it stands out among other iced teas I've tried   
and will be my go-to drink during the hot summer months.
