# Calm is contagious


!!! Quote  "Marcus Aurelius Meditations 11:11" 

    If then it’s not that the things you pursue or avoid are coming at you,  
    but rather that you in a sense are seeking them out,   
    at least try to keep your judgment of them steady,  
    and they too will remain calm and you won’t be seen chasing after or fleeing from them.

I tasted a boxed ice tea made from high-quality oolong tea,   
which was a unique experience for me.  

<!-- more -->
The packaging is tasteful, and the tea is   
refreshing with a subtle oolong flavor and not too much sugar.  
While it cannot compare to the traditional Chinese tea ceremony,   
it stands out among other iced teas I've tried   
and will be my go-to drink during the hot summer months.  

By the way, the quote is from  [_Daily Stoic_](https://dailystoic.com/books/), which had this as the daily thought on June 20th.  
I can also recommend the book.
