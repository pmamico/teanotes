# Introduction to TeaNotes.blog

Welcome to my tea note-taking blog!  
My name is Mic√≥ Papp, and I am passionate about tea.  
I have created this blog to share my personal experiences with different types of tea,  
as well as my thoughts and insights on tea-related topics.  
I would like to enhance the tea drinking experience by engaging multiple senses,  
therefore I will be pairing teas with music, aromas, or other stimuli.  
One of the unique features of this blog is that I will be sharing my tea notes with you.  
As I try different teas, I take detailed notes on their flavor, aroma, and appearance.  
I hope that this blog will inspire you  
to explore the wonderful world of tea and to share your own experiences with others.
